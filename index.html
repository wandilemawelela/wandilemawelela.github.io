                        <p>Welcome to my digital abode! I'm from the beautiful <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eswatini" target="_blank">Kingdom of Eswatini</a>.
                            My journey into tech
                            started at age 13 with an old Pentium computer and has led me to become a passionate
                            software
                            engineer.
                        </p>
                        <p>My coding adventure began with modifying game files and evolved into creating a mobile app to
                            deliver free education. Although the app was developed using PhoneGap, it ignited my love
                            for engineering.</p>
                        <p>College brought new challenges, including a remote job that introduced me to a diverse team
                            of engineers. Balancing studies with work, I honed my skills through code reviews and
                            collaboration.
                        </p>
                        <p>Aside from coding, I produce music as a way to unwind. It's a perfect mix of technical
                            precision and creative freedom.</p>
                        <p>Thank you for visiting! I'm excited to see where this journey leads. Feel free to get in
                            touch!

                                    experience. Key features include comprehensive grading tools, assignment tracking,

                                    I had the opportunity to work on an exciting project as part of my journey with ALX:
                                    Exampad. This project involved building a dynamic web application using Ruby on
                                    Rails for backend development, paired with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive
                                    front-end. The application is designed to serve as a comprehensive quiz platform,
                                    allowing teachers to create quizzes, and enabling students to attempt them, with a
                                    gamified experience that includes a point system and leaderboards. Key features
                                    include Devise for secure user authentication, role-based access control for
                                    students and teachers, and a seamless user interface. This project challenged and
                                    expanded my skills in full-stack development, reinforcing my understanding of Rails
                                    and Tailwind CSS, and ultimately delivering a functional and engaging educational
                                    tool.

                                    In collaboration with students from St. Pauls Methodist School, I had the
                                    opportunity to mentor and contribute to an exciting project: the School Attendance
                                    System. This project involved building a robust web application using Ruby on Rails
                                    for backend development and Bootstrap for front-end styling. The application
                                    includes Devise for user authentication, ensuring secure access for different user
                                    roles such as students, teachers, and parents. Key features implemented in this
                                    project include student management, attendance tracking, and a responsive UI.
                                    Throughout the project, I guided the students in understanding the principles of web
                                    development, enhancing their skills in both Ruby on Rails and Bootstrap, and
                                    fostering a hands-on learning experience. This project serves as a comprehensive
                                    platform for managing school operations, demonstrating the collaborative effort and
                                    technical proficiency of the students under my mentorship.</p>

                                    In collaboration with Tg Gemedi from Ethiopia and Tony Ntahe from Rwanda, I had the
                                    opportunity to contribute
                                    to an exciting project: the AirBnB Clone. Our initial focus was on building a
                                    command interpreter, drawing inspiration from the Monty 0.98 bytecode interpreter
                                    used in the ALX Holberton Software Engineering program. This interpreter plays a
                                    crucial role in managing various AirBnB objects, including User, State, City, and
                                    Place. The project involved creating a parent class, BaseModel, to handle
                                    initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances. We established a
                                    seamless flow for serialization/deserialization, allowing us to work effortlessly
                                    with objects in JSON format. Furthermore, we implemented specific classes for each
                                    AirBnB object, developing an abstracted storage engine with a focus on file storage.
                                    This laid the groundwork for subsequent tasks, such as HTML/CSS templating, database
                                    storage, and front-end integration. The command interpreter, akin to a specialized
                                    Shell, enables the creation, retrieval, updating, and destruction of AirBnB objects,
                                    setting the stage for an innovative web application.</p>

                                    Holberton Software Engineering program. Monty is a scripting language that undergoes
                                    compilation into Monty bytecodes, similar to Python. The
                                    language operates on a distinctive stack, employing specific instructions for
                                    manipulation. Files containing Monty bytecodes conventionally carry the .m
                                    extension. Although not mandatory by the language specification,
                                    this extension is widely adopted in the industry. The language enforces a
                                    one-instruction-per-line rule, allowing any number of spaces before or after the
