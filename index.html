            <h2>Hi, there! I'm Wandile :)</h2>
            <p>Welcome to my digital abode! I'm from the beautiful <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eswatini"
                    target="_blank">Kingdom of Eswatini</a> (Swaziland). My journey into tech started at age 13 with an
                old Pentium
                computer and has led me to become a passionate software engineer.</p>

            <h2>My Coding Journey</h2>
            <p>My coding adventure began with modifying game files and evolved into creating a mobile app to deliver
                free education. Although the app was developed using PhoneGap, it ignited my love for engineering.</p>
            <p>College brought new challenges, including a remote job that introduced me to a diverse team of engineers.
                Balancing studies with work, I honed my skills through code reviews and collaboration.</p>

                <p>Technologies: Ruby on Rails, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PostgreSQL</p>
                <p>This project involved building a dynamic web application using Ruby on Rails for backend development,
                    paired with Tailwind CSS for a modern and responsive front-end. The application is designed to serve
                    as a comprehensive quiz platform, allowing teachers to create quizzes, and enabling students to
                    attempt them, with a gamified experience that includes a point system and leaderboards. Key features
                    include Devise for secure user authentication, role-based access control for students and teachers,
                    and a seamless user interface. This project challenged and expanded my skills in full-stack
                    development, reinforcing my understanding of Rails and Tailwind CSS, and ultimately delivering a
                    functional and engaging educational tool.</p>

                <p>Technologies: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript</p>
                <p>In collaboration with Tg Gemedi from Ethiopia and Tony Ntahe from Rwanda, I had the opportunity to
                    contribute to an exciting project: the AirBnB Clone. Our initial focus was on building a command
                    interpreter, drawing inspiration from the Monty 0.98 bytecode interpreter used in the ALX Holberton
                    Software Engineering program. This interpreter plays a crucial role in managing various AirBnB
                    objects, including User, State, City, and Place. The project involved creating a parent class,
                    BaseModel, to handle initialization, serialization, and deserialization of instances. We established
                    a seamless flow for serialization/deserialization, allowing us to work effortlessly with objects in
                    JSON format. Furthermore, we implemented specific classes for each AirBnB object, developing an
                    abstracted storage engine with a focus on file storage. This laid the groundwork for subsequent
                    tasks, such as HTML/CSS templating, database storage, and front-end integration. The command
                    interpreter, akin to a specialized Shell, enables the creation, retrieval, updating, and destruction
                    of AirBnB objects, setting the stage for an innovative web application.</p>

                <p>Technologies: C</p>
                <p>Monty is a scripting language that undergoes compilation into Monty bytecodes, similar to Python. The
                    language operates on a distinctive stack, employing specific instructions for manipulation. Files
                    containing Monty bytecodes conventionally carry the .m extension. Although not mandatory by the
                    language specification, this extension is widely adopted in the industry. The language enforces a
                    one-instruction-per-line rule, allowing any number of spaces before or after the opcode and its
                    corresponding argument.</p>

                    Claudius from Nigeria as part of the ALX Holberton Software Engineering program. The project
                    involved designing and implementing a command-line interface that mimics the functionality of a Unix
                    shell. The shell supports various commands and features commonly found in Unix-based systems, such
                    as piping, input/output redirection, and background processes. The code is well-organized, modular,
                    and adheres to industry-standard coding practices. In addition to the core features, we also
                    implemented several additional features, such as error handling, signal handling, and built-in
                    commands.</p>

                    Software Engineering program. The printf function is a fundamental tool for printing output in C,
                    and our project aimed to replicate its functionality while also adding additional features and
                    improvements. Our implementation supports various format specifiers, including strings, characters,
                    integers, and floating-point numbers, as well as flags such as width and precision. The code is
                    well-organized and adheres to industry-standard coding practices. We also implemented extensive
                    testing to ensure the function's accuracy and reliability.</p>
